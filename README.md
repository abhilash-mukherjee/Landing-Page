Through this project, I learnt various concepts of CSS and also the various applications of CSS flexbox model. I realized that the most difficult part of any CSS project is to align things perfectly in their desired position.
However, my landing page has a few glitches. When the dimensions of the browser window is changed, the project doesn't look pleasing.
I will learn about creating responsive websites in the future.
